### <a id="challenge">Time Step Challenge</a>

After having danced at least five steps of the Time Step, the Man may initiate a challenge to the Lady by dancing a [Spot Turn](spot_turn.md) or (Silver) a [Cuban Break](cuban_breaks.md). Due to the lack of a physical lead, the Lady will not be able to respond immediately, and will observe the Man dance a [Spot Turn](spot_turn.md) or a [Cuban Break](cuban_breaks.md), but continue herself to dance the Time Step. After the Man has completed his [Spot Turn](spot_turn.md) or [Cuban Break](cuban_breaks.md) and the Lady has danced her Time Step, the Lady will respond by mimicking what the Man danced, while the Man now watches her and dances the Time Step.
