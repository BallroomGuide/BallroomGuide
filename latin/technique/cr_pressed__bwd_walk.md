 <header>Cha Cha/Rumba Pressed Backward Walk
-----------------------------------

|---|---|---|
| 2 | Slightly settle L shoulder weight to allow hips and upper body to turn to R | a |
| 3 | Place RF back and across behind LF (Latin Cross) on ball of foot, with only minimal weight. R knee is placed against the back of the inside of the L knee, LF will remain in place on whole foot. There will be a turn out of 1/4 between the feet | 2 &amp; |
| 4 | Slightly settle R shoulder weight to allow hips and upper body to continue to turn to R | a |
| 5 | LF to side with split weight, lowering R heel to the floor as late as possible so the R heel does not carry weight | 3 |
| 6 | Continue to take full weight to LF | &amp; |

### Note

Because of the strong rotation and action, there will be no (or minimal) hip rotation from the centre line of the body.
