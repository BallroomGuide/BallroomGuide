 <table> <tbody><tr> <td style="width:15%">1</td> <td>On action 2, the settling of the shoulder weight, which allows the slight movement forward of the head and body, creates the body language of the Lady inviting the Man to close toward her.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Without the commencement of weight change backward on step 3, the hip rotation will cause the L hip to end higher than the R hip, creating a very positive and strong bodyline.</td> </tr> </tbody></table>
