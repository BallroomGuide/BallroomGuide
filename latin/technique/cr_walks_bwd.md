 <header>Cha Cha/Rumba Walks Backward
----------------------------

 </header> | 1 | Commence, for example, with LF back, RF held forward with heel released and pressure on toe (Both legs straight) |
|---|---|
| 2 | Using the "settling" hip movement, commence to move RF back on ball of foot, knee slightly flexed, until it passes under body, then extend back to toe |
| 3 | With a smooth action, take weight over RF. Straighten right knee. Lower right heel, at a rate depending on the beat value of the step. A natural turn out of RF occurs, completing the rotational hip action |
| 4 | During the weight change, release left heel without bending the knee. Allow a slight straightening of LF |
| 5 | Retain tone in left leg with pressure on the left (both legs are now straight) |
|  | Continue with a LF Walk in the same manner |
| **Note** | Because of the turn out of the RF, the toe will end in line with the heel of the LF |
