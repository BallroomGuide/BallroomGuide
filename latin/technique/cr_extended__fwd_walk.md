 <header>Cha Cha/Rumba Extended Forward Walk
-----------------------------------

 </header>This type of Forward Walk creates a delay in the rhythm and may provide an emotional change of shape in a figure such as the Lady's [Spiral](../rumba/spiral.html), or [Alemana](../rumba/alemana.html). The description given below is for a RF Extended Forward Walk, as in the Spiral.

 <table> <tbody><tr> <td style="width:15%">1</td> <td style="width:70%">Commence from step 2 of a Spiral with weight on LF</td> <td class="auto-style1">3&amp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Slightly settle L shoulder weight, which will commence the quick turn to L on LF, slightly flexing L knee and extending RF fwd and slightly across without weight, due to the commencement of the Man's lead for the following Spiral Action. R knee straight and foot turned out approximately 1/16 to R, with slight pressure on the outside edge of toe. LF turned out approximately 1/16 to L</td> <td class="auto-style1">a</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>Continue by trasferring split weight and then full weight forward to RF, maintaining straight knee and straightening L knee into a Spiral Action.</td> <td class="auto-style1">4&amp;a1&amp;a</td> </tr> </tbody></table>
