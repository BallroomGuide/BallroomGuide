 <header>Cha Cha/Rumba Extended Forward Walk
-----------------------------------

 </header>This type of Forward Walk creates a delay in the rhythm and may provide an emotional change of shape in a figure such as the Lady's [Spiral](../rumba/spiral.md), or [Alemana](../rumba/alemana.md). The description given below is for a RF Extended Forward Walk, as in the Spiral.

 | 1 | Commence from step 2 of a Spiral with weight on LF | 3&amp; |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | Slightly settle L shoulder weight, which will commence the quick turn to L on LF, slightly flexing L knee and extending RF fwd and slightly across without weight, due to the commencement of the Man's lead for the following Spiral Action. R knee straight and foot turned out approximately 1/16 to R, with slight pressure on the outside edge of toe. LF turned out approximately 1/16 to L | a |
| 3 | Continue by trasferring split weight and then full weight forward to RF, maintaining straight knee and straightening L knee into a Spiral Action. | 4&amp;a1&amp;a |
