 <header>Forward and Backward Runs (Silver)
----------------------------------

 </header>Commence with weight over ball of RF, heel lightly touching the floor. LF held slightly to side on inside edge of ball of foot, knees slightly flexed and veering inward.

As a preparation to move, use a slight raising and lowering of R heel, accompanied by a sympathetic body rise and fall (Count "a")

### Left Foot Forward Lock

 <table class="style1"> <tbody><tr> <td style="width:15%"></td> <td style="width:70%"></td> <td style="width:15%">Count</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>LF forward with split weight, small step, L knee flexed. Hips to R (Ball, flat). Use a slight body raise after foot is placed</td> <td>Q</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>RF forward with split weight, small step, R knee flexed, both knees flexed (Toe). Allow body weight to lower</td> <td>a</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>LF forward, small step, knee flexed, then softly straighten knee. Return hips to central Position (Ball flat). Use a slight body rise after foot is placed</td> <td>Q</td> </tr> </tbody></table>

A Right Foot Forward Run would be the normal opposite, starting with RF

### Left Foot Backward Lock

 <table class="style1"> <tbody><tr> <td style="width:15%"></td> <td style="width:70%"></td> <td style="width:15%">Count</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>LF back with split weight, small step, L knee flexed. Hips to R (Ball, flat). Use a slight body raise after foot is placed</td> <td>Q</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>RF back with split weight, small step, both knees flexed (Toe). Allow body weight to lower</td> <td>a</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>LF back, small step, knee flexed, then softly straighten knee. Return hips to central Position (Ball flat). Use a slight body rise after foot is placed</td> <td>Q</td> </tr> </tbody></table>

A Right Foot Backward Run would be the normal opposite, starting with RF

### Note about the Jive Chasse

In its basic form, the chasse in Jive is a group of three steps taken in any forward, backward, or sideways direction, with or without turn, counted "Q a Q." The first step is taken with split weight, the second step is moved toward the other foot, the third step continues to move in the direction required. The chasse may also be danced in place with feet almost closed

 <table> <tbody><tr> <td style="width:15%">Step 1</td> <td style="width:85%">3/4 beat</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Step 2</td> <td>1/4 beat</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Step 3</td> <td>1 beat</td> </tr> </tbody></table>

For teaching purposes, the Jive chasse may be replaced with a single step (Count "S") or "tap, step" or "step, tap" (Count "Q Q").
