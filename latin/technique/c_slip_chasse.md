### Note about the Cha Cha Chasse

The 4th beat in each bar of music is divided into two equal parts, each part using a half beat. The first two steps of the Cha Cha Cha Chasse are taken on these two half beats (counts '4 and'), and the third step is taken on the first beat of the following bar of music (count '1')  
   
 In its basic form, this chasse is a group of three steps taken in any forward, backward, or sideways direction, with the second step moving toward (or to) the other foot  
   
 Steps 1 and 2 of all Chasses have equal weight distribution (Exception: [Twist Chasse](c_twist_chasse.md))  
   
 The chasse may also be danced in place or without turn  
   
 In the charts, for simplicity, only the foot position of the first step of each chasse is given (Example: RF forward to chasse RLR). Where the third step of each chasse is given. The type of chasse used is also given (Examples: Forward Lock, Compact Chasse, etc.)
