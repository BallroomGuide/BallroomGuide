 <header>Guapacha Timing (Silver)
------------------------

 </header>("Guapacha" is pronounced "Whappacha")

When Guapacha timing is used, the normal timing of 2 3 4&amp;1 is replaced by the timing &amp; 3 4&amp;1. The rhythm is likewise changed from 1 - 1 - 1/2 - 1/2 - 1 to the new rhythm 1/2 -1 - 1/2 -1/2 - 1.1/2, meaning the amount of time spent on the first step is reduced by 1/2 a beat, and the amount of time spent on the final step is increased by 1/2 a beat.
