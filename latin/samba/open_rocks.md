1\) On steps 2 and 5, the Heel lowers toward the floor as the knee straightens  
 2) If this figure is commenced from step 4, the Lady will take step 4 as RF back and turn 1/4 to L between steps 4-5, in the same way as described in steps 1-2 of this figure  
 3) Whether steps 1-6 or only steps 1-3 of this figure are danced, if the first step of the following figure is taken back, the Lady will return to facing the Man before the beginning of the next figure (unless repeating this figure, in which case step 1 is taken as step 4, Fwd Walk Turning)
