1\) When commencing this figure from step 4, the Lady will omit turn on step 4  
 2) Because the Lady ends backing DC while the Man ends facing LOD, she will turn 1/8 to R before step 1 of the following figure, including when repeating this figure  
 3) When dancing this figure only until step 3, because the Lady ends backing DW while the Man ends facing LOD, she will turn 1/8 to L before step 1 of the following figure
