1\) On steps 3-7 the RF points LOD, the LF points to Centre, and the body faces DC; on steps 10-14 the LF point LOD, the RF points to Wall, and the body faces DW  
 2) This figure may be extended, repeating the Volta action for an extra two or four beats after step 7 and/or after step 14  
 3) Steps 6-7 may be replaced by steps 2-3 of a [LF Bota Fogo](/workshop/latin/samba/travel_bf_fwd.md); steps 13-14 may be replaced with steps 2-3 of a [RF Bota Fogo](/workshop/latin/samba/travel_bf_fwd.md)  
 4) (Gold) The first step may be held for an additional beat, with a strong upward stretch before the step and a dropping of energy on the step itself, known as the Dropped Volta (this may be done twice in a row); this may also be used on the eighth step
