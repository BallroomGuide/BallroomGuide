<header>Quickstep Prep Step
-------------------

 </header>The Prep Step is not a figure (and is thus not normally listed in the Syllabus), but a way of commencing Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep. The purpose of the Prep Step is for the Man to ensure the Lady is following his movement and on the correct foot, and also to initiate movement in order that the following figure may be danced smoothly.

Although the Prep Step differs among Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep in Timing, Rhythm, normal Alignment and Direction, the movement is essentially the same.
