 </header>### Man

Commence in Closed Position, backing LOD

 | **Step<span style="color:white">\_</span>\#** | **Steps** | **Turn** | **Alignment** | **Moving** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | RF back | Com to turn L | Backing LOD | LOD |
| 2 | LF closes to RF without weight | 3/8 between 1-2 | Backing DC against LOD |  |
| 3 | Hold position |  | Backing DC against LOD |  |

 | **Step<span style="color:white">\_</span>\#** | **Timing** | **Position** | **Rise &amp; Fall** | **Sway** | **Footwork** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | Closed |  |  | TH |
| 2 | 2 | Closed | Rise on 2 | R | HT (RF) |
| 3 | 3 | Closed | Up. Lower e/o 3 | R | TH (RF) |

**The following step will be taken back in CBMP with the Lady Outside**

1\) The turn between steps 1 and 2 may be danced on the toe of the RF instead of a Heel Turn, in which case the footwork on step 1 is THT and on step 2 T  
 2) The turn between steps 1-2 may be increased by 1/8

### Lady

 | **Step<span style="color:white">\_</span>\#** | **Steps** | **Turn** | **Alignment** | **Moving** |

| 2 | RF to side | 1/4 between 1-2 | Facing Centre | LOD |
| 3 | LF closes to RF | 1/8 between 2-3 | Facing DC against LOD | Under Body |

 | **Step<span style="color:white">\_</span>\#** | **Timing** | **Position** | **Rise &amp; Fall** | **Sway** | **Footwork** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | Closed | Com to rise e/o 1 |  | HT |
| 2 | 2 | Closed | Cont to rise | L | T |
| 3 | 3 | Closed | Cont to rise. Lower e/o 3 | L | TH |
