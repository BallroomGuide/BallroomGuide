|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | LF fwd | Com to turn L | Facing DC | DC |
| 2 | RF back, R side leading | 3/8 between 1-2, body turns less | Backing LOD | DC |
| 3 | LF back in CBMP | 1/8 between 2-3 | Backing DC | DC |
| 4 | RF back, LF held in CBMP | 1/8 between 3-4, then 1/4 on 4 (Pivot) | Backing Centre to facing LOD | Centre |

| 3 | 2 | Fallaway | Cont to rise |  | TH |
| 4 | 3 | Closed | Up. Lower e/o 4 |  | THT |

1\) The pivot on step 4 may be turned 1/8 less or 1/8 more to end facing DW or DC  
 2) When danced into a corner, omit all turn after step 3 to end facing DC of new LOD

 2) When danced into a corner, turn 1/8 less on step 3 (Pivot) to regain Closed position, and make no further turn to end backing DC of new LOD  
 3) The head may keep her head to the left throughout or turn it to the R on step 2 and return to normal position during the Pivot on step 3
