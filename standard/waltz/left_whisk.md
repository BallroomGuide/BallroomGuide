 </header>### Man

Commence in Closed Position, backing LOD

 | **Step<span style="color:white">\_</span>\#** | **Steps** | **Turn** | **Alignment** | **Moving** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | RF back | Com to turn L | Backing LOD | LOD |
| 2 | LF to side &amp; slightly fwd | 3/8 between 1-2, body turns less | Pointing DW | LOD |
| 3 | RF crosses behind LF | Body completes turn | Facing DW | Under Body |
| 4 | Twist to the R on both feet |  | Toward the alignment of step 7 |  |
| 5 | Continue to twist |  | Toward the alignment of step 7 |  |
| 6 | Continue to twist |  | Toward the alignment of step 7 |  |
| 7 | End with weight on RF | Gradually turn 1 full turn to the R over 4-7, body turns more | Backing DC against LOD |  |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | Closed |  |  | TH |
| 2 | 2 | Closed |  | R | TH |
| 3 | 3 | CPP |  | R | T |
| 4 | 1 | CPP |  |  | Flat (LF), T (RF) |
| 5 | &amp; | Closed |  |  | Flat (LF), T (RF) |
| 6 | 2 | OP |  |  | Flat (LF), T (RF) |
| 7 | 3 | Closed |  |  | TH |

**The following step will be taken back in CBMP with the Lady outside**

1\) The Left Whisk may be commenced in PP moving down LOD, step 1 taken as *RF fwd &amp; across in CBMP, HT* 2) If the Left Whisk is commenced in PP, it may be commenced from step 3, immediately crossing RF behind LF (count 1), continuing with steps 4-7 (count 2&amp;3&amp;)  
3\) If the Left Whisk is commenced in PP, it may be commenced from step 3, immediately crossing RF behind LF (count 1), replacing weight to LF (count 2) and stepping RF to side facing Wall (count 3), and then omitting steps 4-7 to follow instead with a [Contra Check](contra_check.md)

### Lady

Commence in Closed Position, facing LOD

 | **Step<span style="color:white">\_</span>\#** | **Steps** | **Turn** | **Alignment** | **Moving** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | LF fwd | Com to turn L | Facing DC | LOD |
| 2 | RF to side &amp; slightly back | 3/8 between 1-2 | Backing DW | LOD |
| 3 | LF crosses in front of RF | 1/8 between 2-3 | Backing LOD | Under Body |
| 4 | RF fwd, small step | Com to turn R | Facing against LOD | Against LOD |
| 5 | LF fwd, small step | 3/8 between 4-5 | Facing DC | Under Body |
| 6 | RF fwd, small step | 3/8 between 5-6 | Facing Wall | Under Body |
| 7 | LF fwd, small step | 3/8 between 6-7 | Facing DC against LOD | Under Body |

 | **Step<span style="color:white">\_</span>\#** | **Timing** | **Position** | **Rise &amp; Fall** | **Sway** | **Footwork** |

| 7 | 3 | Closed |  |  | TH |

**The following step will be taken forward in CBMP, OP**

1\) The Left Whisk may be commenced in PP moving down LOD, step 1 taken as *LF fwd &amp; across in CBMP* and turning only 1/4 between steps 1-2  
 2) If the Left Whisk is commenced in PP, it may be commenced from step 3, immediately crossing the LF in front of the RF (count 1), continuing with steps 4-7 (count 2&amp;3&amp;)  
 3) If the Left Whisk is commenced in PP, it may be commenced from step 3, immediately crossing the LF in front of the RF (count 1), replacing weight to the RF (count 2), and stepping LF to side facing Centre (count 3), and then omitting steps 4-7 to follow instead with a [Contra Check](contra_check.md)
