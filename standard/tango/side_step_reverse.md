 | **Step<span style="color:white">\_</span>\#** | **Steps** | **Turn** | **Alignment** | **Moving** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | LF fwd in CBMP | Com to turn L | Facing DC | DC |
| 2 | RF to side &amp; slightly back | 1/4 between 1-2 | Facing DC against LOD | DC |
| 3 | LF fwd in CBMP | 1/8 between 2-3 | Facing against LOD | Against LOD |
| 4 | RF fwd, R side leading | Body turn to L | Facing against LOD | Against LOD |
| 5 | Transfer weight to LF, L side leading |  | Backing LOD | LOD |
| 6 | Transfer weight to RF, R side leading |  | Facing against LOD | Against LOD |
| 7 | LF back, small step, L side leading | 1/8 to L | Backing DC | LOD |
| 8 | RF back, small step, toe turned in | 1/8 between 7-8 | Backing Centre | DC |
| 9 | LF fwd in CBMP | 1/8 to L gradually over 9-11 | Facing Wall | Wall |

1\) Steps 1-3 and 9-11 are each the [Progressive Side Step](side_step.md), although steps 1-3 turn more than usual  
 2) Steps 5-7 are a [LF Rock](rock_LF.md)  
 3) Because of the side lead on steps 4-7, there will be a slight turn out of the back foot, which is not reflected in the alignments until step 7 when full weight transfer is achieved and the 1/8 to L is acknowledged. The turn out of the back foot results in a difference in amount of foot turn for the Man and Lady between steps 7-8  
 4) Steps 8-11 may be replaced with steps 4-6 of the [Open Reverse Turn](open_reverse_turn.md), using a Closed Finish or Open Finish
