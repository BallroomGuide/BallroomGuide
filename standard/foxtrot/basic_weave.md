1\) This figure may be commenced facing Centre of the new LOD, turning an additional 1/8 to L between steps 1-2 or steps 5-6 of the Basic Weave  
 2) This figure may be commenced facing DC of the new LOD, turning an additional 1/8 to L between steps 1-2 and steps 5-6 of the Basic Weave  
 3) Steps 4-7 are known as the Weave Ending, which is used in the following figures: [Natural Weave](natural_weave.md), [Basic Weave](basic_weave.md), [Weave from PP](weave_from_pp.md), and [Bounce Fallaway with Weave Ending](bounce_fallaway.md)  
 4) Steps 3 and 4 may be repeated once (this is known as the *Extended Weave*)
