 3) This figure may be commenced moving toward Centre, making 1/8 less turn between steps 2-3  
 4) Step 3 may turn an additional 1/8 so that steps 4 and 5 are taken backing and moving DC, turning then only 1/4 between 5-6 to return to a normal alignment  
 5) Although the feet are facing DW on step 6, the body remains facing Wall, and will complete turn on step 1 of the following figure
