1\) May be commenced facing LOD, making the normal amounts of turn across steps 1-3, but then turning an additional 1/8 between steps 3-4  
 2) May be commenced in PP facing DW and moving LOD or facing Wall and moving DW, returning to Closed Position on step 2  
 3) When danced at a corner, dance step 3 ended facing Wall, then dance steps 4-6 backing the new LOD without turn  
 4) Note the unusual rise during the Back Feather (steps 4-6)  
 5) When dancing steps 1-7 at a corner to follow with the [Basic Weave](basic_weave.md), maintain the amounts of turn given in the charts to end step 4 backing DW of the new LOD  
 6) When dancing steps 1-7 at a corner to follow with the [Basic Weave](basic_weave.md), the turn over steps 4-5 may be omitted to end backing DW of the new LOD  
 7) Steps 7-9 are known as the Feather Finish, which is used in the following figures: [Reverse Turn &amp; Feather Finish](reverse_turn.md), [Closed Impetus &amp; Feather Finish](closed_impetus.md), [Curved Feather to Back Feather &amp; Feather Finish](curved_feather_back.md)  
 8) Although the feet are facing DW on step 9, the body remains facing Wall, and will complete turn on step 1 of the following figure

 2) Note the heel is not lowered on step 2, as it would be in a Feather Step, due to the increased amount of turn  
 3) May be commenced in PP facing DC and moving LOD or facing LOD and moving Wall, returning to Closed Position on step 2  
 3) When danced at a corner, dance step 3 ended backing Wall, then dance steps 4-6 facing the new LOD without turn  
 4) When dancing steps 1-7 at a corner to follow with the [Basic Weave](basic_weave.md), the amounts of turn given in the charts may be maintained to end step 7 backing Wall of the new LOD  
 5) When dancing steps 1-7 at a corner to follow with the [Basic Weave](basic_weave.md), the turn over steps 4-5 may be omitted to end backing DW of the new LOD  
 6) Note the unusual rise during the Back Feather (steps 4-6)
